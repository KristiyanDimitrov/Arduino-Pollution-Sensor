# The Scenario
Local authorities such as Coventry are required to monitor the environment and report their findings to DEFrA. There are a number of targets imposed by the government. At the moment the equipment to do this is expensive. There are guidelines issued by DEFRA that explain what should be monitored and the acceptable levels as well as guidance on purchasing the equipment to carry this out.

### There are two levels of monitoring:

 - General monitoring through the use of large numbers of sensors to help identify the blackspots.
 - Specialist units that can be placed in the worst blackspots that are capable of capturing a wider range of data at a higher accuracy. There is an example of this on Ball Hill. The systems are heavy, expensive and difficult to operate and are therefore only installed whre there is an existing pollution problem.
 - There are already companies providing solutions to point 2 but little on the market to give an overall picture.

You have been approached by an environmental monitoring company to develop the prototype of a new range of low-cost smart sensor boxe which they plan to sell to local authorities. These should capture data and send it over a wifi network to a central server. They also want a smartphone app that residents can use to find out about the pollution levels where they are, track over time and warn them if they exceed specified limits.

### They would like to be able to monitor:

 - Temperature
 - Humidity
 - Light levels
 - Levels of UV
 - CO2
 - Airbourne dust particles
 - Ambient background noise
 - Low frequency vibration caused by lorries, buses and aircraft

### They would like to have a smartphone app to use the data in the following ways:

 - Map of the area with overlays showing pollution levels.
 - Summary of the pollution in the user's current location mapped against acceptable norms
 - Alerts if pollution exceeds the agreed levels.
